    "Because the intent of this presentation is for education to those with little experience with programming, maximally efficient algorithm development is not explored here. In fact, the algorithm presented here intentially implements one of the simplest recursive approaches to discerning whether a sequence is graphical and deploys the relatively intuitive Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting the sequence. Furthermore, the Python programming language was chosen because the high-level language affords greater reading clarity (but not necessary the best performance)."

    "A central idea of any algorithm using the Havel-Hakimi Theorem to decide whether a given integer sequence is graphical is that we can recursively deploy the reduction process to the subsequence produced after deleting the leading integer. In the HavelHakimi function defined below, instead of deleting the leading integer, I track a \"startIndex\" to allow me to work with subsequences of sequence passed as arguments of the HavelHakimi function. By incrementing this startIndex and passing it along with the original sequence, I effectively tell the function to cut off (ignore) the terms up to this index. <br>\n",

    "Of course, possibilities 1 & 3 are very problematic, and therefore the algorithm will terminate and return False in these cases. There are other properties that could be checked to discover if the subsequence cannot be a graphical sequence. Because checking for these other properties only improves the overall efficiency with which non-graphical sequences are discovered and is not required for the algorithm to operate and terminate validly, these additional cases were not checked.<br>\n",

Similarly to the the above discussion, checking for additional graphical subsequences is possible, but could only contribute to a very modest gain in computational efficiency.<br>\n",
